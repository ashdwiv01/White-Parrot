# Abstract

We all have done courses, yes we have binged watched TV series in between, played Fifa, even forgotten about them until the mail comes that then course is already in last week. Most people stop courses in between because it just boring. 
Whiteparrot is a puzzle designed to force student learn certain things to just like a typical course to go to the next stage in the puzzle. The puzzle starts with basic things and gradually gets complicated.
